clone the kernel
once kernel is cloned, copy config to ./.config
config is at arch/arm64/configs/
arch/arm64/configs/defconfig is config for 8M devices
arch/arm64/configs/imx_v7_defconfig is for older devices
if all else fails just copy /proc/config.gz to .config
Then, run make menuconfig
save config
Then run make -j8
This builds the kernel, kernel image is saved at arch/arm64/boot/Image
then, to make modules, run make modules_install INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/path_where_you_want_to_install
