If you want to add a configuration option to the kernel, you can do it in a few ways.
This is the way I did it to make it stick, though.
I went to the folder arch/arm64/configs and opened the following files:
imx.config
imx_v8_defconfig
defconfig
and added my config options there.
This is probably not the best way of doing it, but this is what worked after hours of trying different things, like adding config options to the kernel through yocto.
