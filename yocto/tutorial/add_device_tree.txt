To add a new device tree to the kernel, you need to do a couple of things.
First you need to add the file to arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/.
Then, you need to add it to the Makefile at arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/Makefile.
Finally, you need to go to the Yocto source, to sources/meta-imx/meta-imx-bsp/conf/machine
In here are machine files, these files contain a list of device tree files to build and include in the image.
Add it here.
